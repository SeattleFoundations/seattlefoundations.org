# Foundationsâ€™ Vision & Mission

Seattle, while excellent for building businesses, lacks the ecosystem necessary for founding them. Foundations, an invite-only community of tech founders, aims to change this by providing the essential scaffolding for the most capable and ambitious local entrepreneurs.

> Our vision is a thriving startup ecosystem where established leaders, up-and-comers, and new entrants can connect, share experiences, and grow together.

We're building a fabric for our startup community that fosters deep relationships and knowledge sharing, crucial for a high-performing ecosystem and anchored by a physical space in the center of Seattle. Our goal is to support founders efficiently, respecting their most valuable asset: time.

# The Importance of Community and Diversity

We've identified two distinct groups of potential members who want to engage with the community in different ways:

- **Founders in Residence**: 0 to seed founders who are working torward product/market-fit and are in the first six months of their membership. For founders in residence, the Foundations space is their full-time office.

- **Members**: Active or former founders and operators who look to Foundations for peer mentorship, the opportunity to connect, and/or the desire to give back to those a few steps behind them on the journey. For members, the Foundations office is their third space and visited up to a couple of times a week.

# The Role of Physical Space and Structured Programs

Foundations is located in a 5,000 sf office space on Capitol Hill designed to handle events of up to 75 people. It includes:

- Five meeting rooms and three phone booths
- A deep-work space and two casual hangout spaces
- affordable adjacent parking garage
  -50 desks

**Structured** programs include:

- Founder Circles
- Member-only events (Friday happy hour, monthly founder fireside chat, First Thursday demo day)
- Public events (Monthly community happy hour)
- A founder in residence program where early-stage members can access free desk space and mentorship throughout a 6-month process

# Ownership & Leadership

Foundations is designed to support the Seattle startup ecosystem: Full-stop. Our board (to be announced soon) consists of some of the most respected local founders, VCs, and operators dedicated to our mission. Additionally, 70% of the equity in Foundations will be granted to our first 200 members, vesting over 5 years of active membership.

# The Sustainable and Long-term Approach

Foundations is organized as a benefit corporation with the goal of becoming financially self-sustaining, owned by the community it serves, and with a long-term mandate to evaluate additional mission-aligned revenue opportunities. These may include:

- Membership dues
- A formal incubator
- An accelerator
- Investment vehicles
- The distribution of dividends
